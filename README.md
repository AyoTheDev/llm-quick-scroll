# Gemini Quick Scroll

Gemini Quick Scroll is a Google Chrome extension designed to enhance your navigation experience when interacting with the Gemini web interface. It provides features to quickly scroll and navigate through lengthy conversations.

## Features

- **Dynamic Navigation Bar:** Injects a dedicated navigation sidebar into the Gemini chat interface.
- **Chat Item Navigation:** Automatically populates this sidebar with links to each user query and AI response in the current chat.
- **Concise Summaries:** Generates a short summary (e.g., the first 10 words) for each query and response in the navigation links for easy identification.
- **Click-to-Scroll:** Instantly jump to a specific query or response by clicking its summary in the navigation bar.
- **Real-time Updates:** The navigation bar dynamically updates as new messages appear, adding new queries and responses automatically.
- **Collapsible Sidebar:** The navigation bar can be collapsed to save screen space and expanded when needed.
- **Automatic Layout Adjustment:** The extension adjusts the main Gemini content area to prevent overlap with the navigation bar.

## Advice for 'Vibe coding'

- Have an idea of what it is you're trying to implement, try to think in terms of focused and singular 'features' that you envision the software having
- Come up with step by step of how the feature or solution works, algorithmically whare the logical steps in youre feature?
- Ask your AI or Agent to complete one step at a time
- Test each step to ensure it works as expected
- Commit/save your changes after you're happy with each step
- Iterate, restarting as much as you need to till youve got a working solution for each step

I have put MINIMAL effort into this project beyond 2- 5 prompt 'vibe coding' sessions.
